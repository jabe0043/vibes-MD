## Usability Testing Documentation
· [Usability Testing Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZF5R8biDiRr55XDvo1qsom-PixNm6zXZlzmD-wQDS54/edit?usp=sharing)

As part of our commitment to optimizing user experience, we conducted extensive usability testing for the Vibes Social Network. Participants were asked to engage with the app, performing tasks such as locating and checking into venues, adding friends, and posting reviews. Their interactions were thoughtfully observed to identify any usability challenges and gather direct feedback.

Key Points:

The objective was to ensure the app's functionality aligns with user expectations and is intuitive in real-world scenarios.
Testing sessions were guided by a script that encouraged participants to verbalize their thought processes, providing valuable insights into user behaviour and app interaction.
A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) was signed by participants to maintain confidentiality while allowing us to record and analyze the sessions.
Outcomes of these sessions are crucial for the iterative design process, enabling us to refine Vibes Social Network to better serve our users’ needs.

## Usability Test Results
· [Usability Test Results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10O_8ZOAa4maMITb2VfgGmkREkzL5PggGIlymQaWSGTk/edit?usp=sharing)

Usability testing for the Vibes app revealed essential feedback for interface optimization. Users expressed a need for clearer map visuals and icons, a more intuitive friend-adding feature, simplified venue information access, and better confirmation for actions like check-ins and reviews. This feedback will inform targeted improvements to ensure the app is user-friendly and intuitive.

## Technical Research 
 · [Technical Research Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A0uaM2kz7i7hdLGav0ljEtRE50FIkkQjobpG3wOP1Wc/edit)

Phase 1 of Vibes was developed using React Native and Expo Go. React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that allows for cross-platform mobile development using a single codebase. Expo Go allows developers and users to preview and test pre-production applications, without the need to build or compile the platform's native binary code. In compliance with Apple's regulations mandating deployment certificates for iOS development builds, the Vibes hand-off process will entail providing a file that can be locally executed within an integrated development environment (IDE), in conjunction with the Expo Go mobile application. This approach allows for previewing Vibes on iOS devices while bypassing the restrictions associated with Apple's deployment requirements.
